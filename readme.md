# Epic Saga

This is a child theme to use alongside the Saga parent theme.  This theme boasts a sidebar. Given the single column layout, the sidebar is off-canvas and can be "pulled" in using a toggle button. 
The sidebar is also completely responsive, and fits nicely on all screen sizes. 

## Demo and Other Stuff

You can check out the online home of the child theme at [this link](http://designby.momekh.com/epicsaga/). 

Issues, questions etc, ask here on GitHub. That's why we're here. :)

### Dependencies 

Of course, this theme depends on the parent theme Saga. You need the Saga theme installed to use Epic Saga. Epic, I know.

I have used [Sidr](https://github.com/artberri/sidr) for the flyout sidebar.

This theme is sassy, with the sass files included.
